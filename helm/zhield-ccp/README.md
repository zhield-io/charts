# Custom Cloud Provider

The CCP (custom cloud provider) provides the required functionality to operate
a K8 cluster as part of the Zhield platform. This includes complying with the
standard interface of the ["Cluster AutoScaler"](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/externalgrpc/README.md) components.
